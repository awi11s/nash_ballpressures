# nash_ballpressures
Nashville SC technical analytics project

main.py - the main script that parses through the tracking data and creates a CSV deliverable of each
instance of on-ball pressure througout the match.

utils.py - various functions that were used in the Main file.

Much of the code contains commented explanations. The final CSV is found in the csv_data folder. The JSON files were not included in the respository due to 
confidentiality.
